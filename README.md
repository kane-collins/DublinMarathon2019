Here I examine some statistics from the 2019 Dublin Marathon. A great analysis has also been done [here](https://medium.com/running-with-data/a-data-analysis-of-the-dublin-marathon-48138724973e), and I try to avoid covering the same material. 
### Basic Analysis
One of the first items of interest is average finishing time. The average finish time was 4:18:55 while the average chip time was just 4:17:14, so the average runner took over one minute and forty seconds to cross the start line. 
It is also clear, just from looking at the plot that there is a significant spike in times under four hours as many runners push themselves to break that important mental barrier.

### Analysis of club runners
It was found that 72% (12,851 out of 17,732) finishers do not belong to any club. This is a very high percentage and is somewhat unexpected. This is possibly due to the large increase in recreational runners in recent years. Further analyses could explore this trend. I would hypothesise that even twenty years ago, the percentage of club runners would be much higher. 

There were 356 different clubs represented. Of these 81 were large (20 or more participants). In addition, it was found that non-club runners are approximately 12.5 minutes slower than club runners. 
The best represented clubs are shown below. Some clubs are not surprising to see on this list such as Raheny AC and Marathon Club Ireland. However, there are also some notable absences. Neither Donore Harriers nor Dundrum South Dublin make the top 10 as some might have expected.

### Fastest clubs
Below you can see the fastest clubs, as defined by the mean chip time. Obviously, this measure has some serious issues as a club could only have a single runner represented. If that runner runs a fast time, then the club will be very fast. For this reason, I have also created a plot of the fastest large (20 or more participants) clubs.

Clearly there is much room here for further work, such as a comparison with previous years and indeed other marathon events. Nonetheless, some interesting insights can be obtained, particularly relating to the relationship between athletic club membership and performance.
